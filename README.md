# Implementation_of_2D_DFT
Implementation of 2D DFT using Message Passing Interface (MPI) (C++)<br/>

This implementation belongs to Xiaofei Qiu, Computer engineering student in Georgia Tech<br/>

This implementation assume the input image has same height and width <br/>

The code is present in dft.cc <br/>

Tower is defual image data (256 x 256) <br/>

Defult using 16 cpu to do DFT <br/>
